# MyReads Project

In the MyReads Project I have created a bookshelf app that allows users to select and categorize books they have read, currently reading or want to read. The project is built in react using the starter code provided by the Udacity. Instructions for installing and launching the project are below.

## Instructions for Installing and Launching the project

To get started with the app right away:

- clone the repository into your local machine `git clone ${repo_link}`
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
